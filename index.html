        <p>In the Winter of 2016, I packed everything I owned into my old school Nissan and left to live in a new city. It was difficult to leave at first. Though, after a while it got easier and I was able to survive out on my own. That came to an end and eventually I moved back home to continue taking classes and I'm really glad that I did. Along the way I changed my major, made some incredible friends, sold the car for eight hundred dollars, and ran into all sorts challenges. I'm still in the early parts of my life now studying Computer Sciences and continuing as a pianist with knowledge of music theory and a passion for performance that I've always cherished. Now I find myself practicing classical piano pieces and coding in my free time while also finding any moment to spend with my amazing friends. It is a bit surreal to think about the past and how far I have come, but eventually everything may settle down a bit. Until then, I'm looking forward to new adventures and the good times to come.

        <p>I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who has supported me up to this point in my life, with special thanks to Marcus, Alex, Chase, Aeryk, the entire BH group chat, and an old friend who taught me from my mistakes how to become a better person.</p>
            <p>Proud owner of 50 thousand Vicoins that are completely <del>valuable</del> <ins>worthless</ins>, and I plan to update this website over time.</p>
        <p>Be kind and thank you all.</p>
