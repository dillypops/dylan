        <p>In the Winter of 2016, I packed everything I owned into my old school Nissan and left to live in a new city. I stayed in an apartment with two of my friends all while trying to work teaching music and continue going to school. Along the way I changed my major, made some incredible friends, sold the car for eight hundred dollars, and ran into all sorts challenges that people go through during life. This is still sort of the beginning, but I am currently working on a Computer Science degree and cant wait to get this over with. I was once a major in music with a broad idea of music theory, a passion for performance, and a great teacher, but now I find myslef mastering classical piano pieces and coding in my free time. It is a bit surreal to think about the past and how far I have come, but eventually everything may settle down. Until then, I'm looking forward to new adventures and the good times to come.
        </p>
        <p>I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who has supported me up to this point in my life, with special thanks to Marcus, Alex, Chase, Aeryk, the entire BH group chat, and an old friend who taught me from my mistakes how to become a better person.</p>
            <p>Proud owner of 50 thousand Vicoins that are completely <del>valuable</del> <ins>worthless</ins>, and I plan to update this website over time.</p>
        <p>Be kind and thank you all.</p>
