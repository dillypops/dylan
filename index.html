        <p>In the Winter of 2017, I packed everything I owned into my old school Nissan and left to live in Galveston. I stayed in an apartment with two of my friends all while trying to work teaching music and continue going to school at the same time. Along the way I changed my major, made some incredible friends, lost my car to a hurricane, bought a new car, moved back home, and ran into all sorts challenges that people go through during life. This is still sort of the beginning, but I am currently working on a Computer Science degree and cant wait to get this over with. Looking forward to the good times to come!
        </p>
        <p>I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who has supported me up to this point in my life, with special thanks to Marcus, Alex, Chase, Aeryk, the entire BH group chat, and an old friend who taught me from my mistakes how to become a better person.</p>
        <p>I plan to update this website over time, but maybe I’ll forget or won’t care anymore haha.</p>
        <p>Be kind and thank you all.</p>
